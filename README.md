optimized-php-ini
=================

This is my own optimized/re-organized php.ini file

Use this at your own risk!  This is only tested on my own systems.  It should, in theory, be safe as it's only a re-organization of the existing options, with my own comments in order to simplify the understanding of what they mean, but there's no guarantee that it will work if you're using features that are not relevant in my projects.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS - I have removed all windows-specific options from this file, it *will not work* for you without those options present.  I do not run PHP on windows, and do not wish to maintain those options in this file.

This file also is set up to use a particular directory structure that is non-standard.  If you use this, please make sure you adapt any options that indicate a directory structure to your system.
